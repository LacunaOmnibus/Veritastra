=head1 Notes on the design

There are some lessons we have learned from The Lacuna Expanse (TLE) and this design
tries to rectify these issues.

=over

=item Browser Reads.

The web browser should not trigger database writes (planet tick, ship arrival etc.).
When doing a read operation (such as getting the current status).
Any writes (for example when completing a form submission) should be limited to simple
updates that can be performed efficiently.

=item Future events.

Make more use of Beanstalk queue system to carry out actions scheduled for
a future time.

=item Immediate costly events.

Make use of Beanstalk even for actions that are immediate, but might take a fair
amount of processing so resulting in a reduced browser lag.

=item Database Replication.

Make use of L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated> so that we can direct
database reads to multiple mysql replicated slaves, and only send writes to the master.

=item Transactions.

We need to ensure that database writes are wrapped in a transaction

=item Database Normalisation.

Do a little more data normalisation so that resources can be made more 'generic'
rather than hard-coding them into the database structure (e.g. empire).

=item Database over Normalisation.

However don't over-normalise since this will lead to inefficiencies.
